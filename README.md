Telegram Clone Built with Ruby on Rails!

Purpose of this project was to demonstrate the power of Hotwire Native, to develop multiplatform application only using ruby on rails. 

This project uses Stimulus Controllers, SASS, Turbo Streams, Turbo Frames.

Project also focuses on file uploads to demonstrate the limits of Ruby on Rails on Mobile Devices. 

Here is a link to the Presentation at Columbus Ruby Brigade, where I discuss the benefits and draw-backs of using Hotwire Native library.
